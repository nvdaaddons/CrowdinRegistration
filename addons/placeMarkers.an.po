"This add-on is used for saving and searching specific text strings or "
"placemarkers. It can be used on web pages or documents in NVDA's browse "
"mode. It can also be used for saving or searching strings of text in multi-"
"line controls; in this case, if it's not possible to update the caret, the "
"corresponding string will be copied to the clipboard, so that it can be "
"searched using other tools.  The plugin saves the specified strings and "
"placemarkers to files whose name is based on the title and URL of the "
"current document.  This add-on is based on SpecificSearch and "
"Bookmark&Search, developed by the same author. You should uninstall them to "
"use this one, since they have common keystrokes and features."
