*   Authors: Corentin Bacqué-Cazenave, Joseph Lee
* Download [stable version][1]

This plugin adds a layer command to use simplified key combination to navigate table cells.
When the layered commands are enabled, you can perform the following actions:
- Navigate to the previous or next cell horizontally or vertically using arrow keys
- Navigate to the first or last cell of the row or the column using control+arrow keys or Home, End, PageUp and PageDown
- Read the whole row or column without moving the system caret using windows+leftArrow / windows+upArrow
- Read the row or column starting from the current cell using windows+rightArrow / windows+downArrow

Currently supported tables are:

* Browse mode (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.).
* Microsoft Word.

## Commands

* Toggles table navigator layer on and off (unassigned).
