"To configure this add-on, open the NVDA menu, go to Preferences, then "
"Settings, then Speech Logger (NVDA+N, P, S, then press S until you get "
"there, on a default U.S. English keyboard).  There is also an unassigned "
"gesture in the Input Gestures \"Configuration\" category, which you can "
"assign and use to quickly open the add-on's settings directly.  Note: the "
"add-on can only be configured while in the Normal Configuration profile of "
"NVDA.  The add-on is not profile-aware.  If you can think of some use case "
"that requires it to operate differently in different profiles, please "
"contact the author or file an issue on the [GitHub repo][2]."
