"This addon can create a descriptive caption of any JPG or PNG image in File "
"Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Firefox. It does this using "
"machine learning and presents the caption in a window so that the text of "
"the caption can be examined as well as speaking the text."

"First, select an image file in Windows File Explorer, or in a web "
"browser. Chrome, Edge, and Firefox are supported. With the image selected, "
"presss NVDA+x. the addon will respond with \"Captioning, please wait...\" as "
"the image is analyzed by the machine learning module and "
"captioned. Depending on your machine's CPU speed, captioning will take "
"between two and five seconds. After captioning is complete, a window will "
"open with the caption of the image and the caption will be read. When you "
"are finished browsing the caption, you can press escape to close the caption "
"window."

"There are several things to be aware of when using the XPoseImageCaptioner "
"to get the best results:"

"XPoseImageCaptioner captioning works best for photographs and cartoons or "
"other artwork. It also can work fairly well for memes and ads. It does not "
"work well for charts and is not a replacement for OCR. If you have an image "
"of a text document, use an OCR addon rather than XPoseImageCaptioner."

#. type: Bullet: '2. '
msgid ""
"AI captioning can tell you what is in an image but can't tell you why it is "
"there. ALT text should still be used to find out about an image's "
"context. For example, on a news site you may see an image with the ALT text "
"\"a general gives testimony in a congressional hearing about the millitary "
"budget\", the AI caption could be something like \"a man in a formal "
"millitary uniform speaks into a microphone while seated in a wood paneled "
"room\". The AI caption tells you what is in the image, but the ALT text "
"ideally should tell you why its there."

"The BLIP neural network, on which the XPoseImageCaptioner addon is based, "
"can only output English text. Retraining the model to support languages "
"other than English is not feasable at this time."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '4. '
msgid ""
"While the captions produced are currently very close to the state of the art "
"for AI captioning of images, they are not always 100% accurate. Please use "
"with caution and common sense and never in place of OCR. Also, do not rely "
"on the output for dangerous or high-risk situations."

"Currently, XPoseImageCaptioner works for websites that don't require a "
"login. For example, the public pages of organizations such as [Guiding Eyes "
"for the Blind](https://www.guidingeyes.org/) or "
"[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/). Pages that require a login, such as Facebook or "
"Twitter, are not yet supported because the addon must download an image from "
"the web site independantly to caption it and can't do so if a login is "
"required. As a workaround, any image from sites requiring a login could be "
"downloaded to the local machine and captioned using the addon in File "
"Explorer."

#. type: Bullet: '6. '

"XPoseImageCaptioner only works on FireFox when an image does not have ALT "
"text. FireFox does not provide a direct link to an image file to a screen "
"reader if an image has ALT text. Without this information, the addon can't "
"download the image for the AI to caption. Chrome and Microsoft Edge do not "
"have this limitation, and work regardless of whether an image has ALT text "
"or not."
