"MathCAT is designed to eventually replace MathPlayer because MathPlayer is "
"no longer supported. MathCAT generates speech and braille from MathML. The "
"speech for math produced by MathCAT is enhanced with prosody so that it "
"sounds more natural. The speech can be navigated in three modes using the "
"same commands as MathPlayer. In addition, the navigation node is indicated "
"on a braille display. Both Nemeth and UEB technical are supported."

"MathCAT has a number of configuration options that control speech, "
"navigation, and braille.  Many of these can be set in the MathCAT settings "
"dialog (found NVDA Preferences menu).  For more information on these "
"settings, see the [MathCAT documentation](https://nsoiffer.github.io/MathCAT/"
