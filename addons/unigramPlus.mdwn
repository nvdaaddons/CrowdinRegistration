## about ##

Use Unigram in a more comfortable and productive way. This addon provides many hotkeys for a quick and comfortable use of Unigram and makes a lot of small improvements.

## Some of the major improvements are: ##

* Adds a significant improvement to the display of messages such as a poll, a link, or a message with attached media.
* When focus enters the list of chats, it removes such phrases as: "chats, tab, selected list". And when the focus hits the list of messages, the phrase "list".
* The name and size of the file will be spoken when the cursor is focused on the "Open File" button or the "Download File" button, and when the cursor is focused on the play button of the audio file, you will hear its name and duration.
* When focus is placed on a voice message that is currently being played, first information about the time of its playback is announced, and then all other information.
* When the focus is on a message that contains information about a call, the duration of this call is announced.
* When focusing on a selected message in a chat, you will first hear the information that it is selected, and then the content of the message.
* Now, when moving in the chat, the phrase "Seen" will not be pronounced at all, and the phrase "Not seen" will be pronounced before the content of the message. This feature currently only works in English, Russian, Ukrainian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Croatian, Turkish, and Persian.
* Significantly improved the function of recording voice messages. Recording, sending and canceling the recording of a voice message are accompanied by characteristic sounds.
* Also, when performing these functions, the focus remains in its position and does not jump to either the record button or the message input field.
* If the media attached to the message is opened using the spacebar, then after closing it, the focus will return to the last element that was in focus.
* The add-on allows you to completely disable the announcement of progress bars, as well as disable only the announcement of the progress bar for playing voice messages.

Please note that often when pressing the enter key on the group that we want to open, the list of threads may not be displayed and then it is necessary to set the focus on this group again and press the enter key. As a rule, after the second press, a list of threads is displayed, and after that we can press a key combination that will move the focus to this list.
