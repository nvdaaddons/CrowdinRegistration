"The Quick Notetaker add-on is a wonderful tool which allows writing notes "
"quickly and easily anytime and from any app the user is using.  Whether the "
"user is watching a video for example, or participating in a meeting on Zoom, "
"teams or Google meet, they can easily and smoothly open the notetaker and "
"take a note. In order to create a quick note, NVDA + Alt + n key combination "
