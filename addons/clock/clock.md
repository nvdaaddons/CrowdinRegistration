This add-on enables the advanced clock, alarm timer and calendar functionality for NVDA.

You can configure NVDA to announce time and date in formats other than what Windows provides by default. Additionally, you can obtain the current day, week number, as well as the remaining days before the end of the current year, and you can also set automatic time announcement on specified interval. There's also a stopwatch and Alarm timer features built-in to the add-on that lets you time your tasks, such as copying files, installing programs, or cooking meals.

Notes:

* if you install the add-on as an update, during the installation process, the wizard detects if the old configuration is compatible with the new one and offers to correct it before installing, then you'll just have to validate the OK button to confirm that.
* On Windows 10 and later, you can use Alarms and Clock app to manage stopwatch and timers.
