## Usage
This simple add-on makes possible to create application-specific dictionaries for NVDA.
To use the add-on, just go to the application for wich you want a dictionary for, and press NVDA+control+shift+d.
The normal NVDA dictionary dialog will open for you to add entries valid only for the active application (the application name should appear in the dialog title).
The default add-on shortcut can be changed through NVDA's input gestures dialog: under configuration node, expand the node that says "Shows the application-specific dictionary dialog".


## Command
NVDA+Control+Shift+d


## Automatic update
This add-on includes an automatic update feature.
The check for a new version will be executed everytime NVDA is loaded.
If you want this, go to NVDA, Preferences, Options and in the add-on category check the check box.
