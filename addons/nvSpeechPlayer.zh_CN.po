"The 70s and 80s saw much research in speech synthesis. One of the most "
"prominent synthesis models that appeared was a formant-frequency synthesis "
"known as Klatt synthesis. Some well-known Klatt synthesizers are Dectalk and "
"Eloquence. They are well suited for use by the blind as they are extremely "
"responsive, their pronunciation is smooth and predictable, and they are "
"small in memory footprint. However, research soon moved onto other forms of "
"synthesis such as concatinative speech, as although this was slower, it was "
"much closer to the human voice. This was an advantage for usage in "
"mainstream applications such as GPS units or telephone systems, but not "
"necessarily so much of an advantage to the blind, who tend to care more "
"about responsiveness and predictability over prettiness."

"70年代和80年代在语音合成方面进行了大量的研究。出现的最突出的合成模型之一是称"
"为Klatt合成的共振峰频率合成。一些着名的Klatt合成器是Dectalk和Eloquence。它们"
"非常适合盲人使用，因为它们反应速度快，发音平滑且可预测，并且内存占用小。然"
"而，研究很快转向了其他方向，例如连词，尽管这种情况比较慢，但它更接近于人类的"
"声音。这对于在诸如GPS单元或电话系统之类的主流应用中的使用是有利的，但对于盲人"
"来说不一定有这么大的优势，盲人往往更关心响应性和对速度和可预测性。"

"Although synthesizers such as Dectalk and Eloquence continued to be "
"maintained and available for nearly 20 years, now they are becoming harder "
"to get, with multiple companies saying that these, and their variants, have "

"Both Dectalk and Eloquence were closed-source commercial products "

"like Dectalk or Eloquence, or at least restart research and conversation "
"around this synthesis method."

"The eSpeak synthesizer, itself a free and open-source product has proved "
"well as a replacement to a certain number of people in the community, but "
"many people who hear it are extremely quick to point out its \"metallic\" "

"Speech Player still prefer eSpeak as their synthesizer of choice, they would "
"still hope to try and understand better this strange resistance to eSpeak "
"which may have something to do with eSpeak's spectral frequency synthesis "
"verses Klatt synthesis. It may also have to do with the fact that consonants "
"are also gathered from recorded speech and can therefore be perceived as "
"being injected into the speech stream."
