#: buildVars.py:29
msgid ""
"* Added a setting in add-on settings under status announcements to announce "
"when a cart finishes playing (NVDA will say 'cart stopped').\n"
"* In add-on settings/status announcements, cart name checkbox is now cart "
"announcement check list box with the former setting becoming a checkable "
"option.\n"
"* In Studio 6.20 and later, SPL Controller can be used to control local "
"Studio and/or Remote Studio. A new setting in add-on settings dialog under "
"Advanced settings panel allows configuring SPL Controller coverage/scope "
"between both local Studio and Remote Studio or one or the other. In earlier "
"Studio releases, SPL Controller layer will control local Studio.\n"
"* In local Studio, performing track elapsed (Alt+Shift+T) and remaining time "
"(Control+Alt+T) commands will also announce elapsed and remaining time for "
"the currently playing voice track and/or cart. In addition, pressing SPL "
"Controller, R will announce remaining duration of the playing track, voice "
"track, or cart for local Studio.\n"
"* Metadata streaming and status announcements settings panels will not be "
"shown when opening add-on settings screen from Remote Studio.\n"
"* Settings to report library scans and listener requests will not be shown "
"in add-on settings when opened from Remote Studio.\n"
"* In local Studio, NVDA will announce track starts value correctly (SPL "
"Assistant, S).\n"
"* In local Studio, NVDA will no longer announce wrong information when "
"locating various screen information such as weather data if error log button "
"is shown on screen.\n"
"* Library scan announcement toggle command (NVDA+Shift+R) is now limited to "
"local Studio.\n"
"* Changed the following SPL Assistant JAWS layout commands: hour duration (H "
"to T), hour remaining duration (Shift+H to H), library scan (Shift+R to "
"Alt+T), cart edit/insert (T to number row 0).\n"
"* Resolved \"Time Scheduled/Time\" column announcement and usage in local "
"Studio 6.20, including reporting of wrong column content when vertical "
"column navigation is set to \"Time Scheduled\", NVDA reporting \"Time "
"Scheduled not found\" when this column is configured as a columns explorer "
"slot, and wrong column title shown in playlist transcripts.\n"
"* Resolved issues working with results from insert tracks dialog in local "
"Studio 6.20, including NVDA saying \"Artist not found\" when performing "
"columns explorer commands (Control+NVDA+number row) to obtain artist "
"information, wrong column information announced in columns explorer, and top "
"and bottom beeps being heard.\n"
"* NVDA will no longer include empty column content when generating playlist "
"transcripts in plain text and HTML list formats.\n"
"* In local Studio, NVDA will no longer announce \"no track playing\" when "
"announcing next track title when no tracks are playing but next track title "
"is showing on screen.\n"
"* In Remote Studio, taking playlist snapshots (SPL Assistant, F8) shows more "
"accurate results.\n"
"* In Remote Studio, NVDA will no longer do nothing or play error tones when "
"announcing current and next track titles and is configured to announce track "
"player information."
