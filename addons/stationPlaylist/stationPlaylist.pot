"* NVDA 2025.3.2 or later is required.\n"
"* Add-on settings screen is now available while using Creator, Remote VT, "
"and Track Tool with different settings for each app.\n"
"* NVDA will announce labels for SPL app screens, including track properties, "
"insert tracks dialog's search criteria controls (Studio, Creator, Remote "
"VT), and Studio options dialog.\n"
"* In Studio (local and remote), Creator, and Remote VT, NVDA will play a "
"beep when search is completed in insert tracks dialog when NVDA is "
"configured to play beeps for status announcements from SPL add-on settings/"
"general category.\n"
"* In Studio (local and remote) and Track Tool, NVDA will no longer announce "
"dialog property content (description) in places such as track properties and "
"Studio options screen.\n"
"* In local Studio, NVDA will be less verbose when performing library rescan "
"from insert tracks dialog (Control+Shift+R).\n"
"* In local Studio, NVDA will report library scan count regardless of \"beep "
"for status announcements\" setting from add-on settings.\n"
"* In Remote Studio, when closing options screen (Control+O) while cart "
"explorer is active, it is no longer necessary to reenter Cart Explorer to "
"view updated cart assignments.\n"
"* Resolved several issues while using insert tracks dialog in Remote Studio, "
"including NVDA saying \"scan start\" when pressing Control+Shift+R and "
"verbose output for search results status.\n"
"* In track list in Creator and Track Tool, pressing Alt+number row keys to "
"change column sort order will cause NVDA to announce the new sort order "
"based on the column selected. There will be a delay when performing these "
"commands in Creator.\n"
"* In Creator, Remote VT, and Track Tool, status bar content will be reported "
"when performing read status bar command (NVDA+End/desktop layout, "
"NVDA+Shift+End/laptop layout). In particular, improved status bar content "
"announcement performance in Creator.\n"
"* In Creator and Remote VT, NVDA will announce search results count when "
"searching for tracks in insert tracks dialog.\n"
"* In Creator and Remote VT, NVDA will no longer appear to do nothing or play "
"error tones when reporting playlist information from playlist editor such as "
"playlist hour and day, scheduled, and rotation."
