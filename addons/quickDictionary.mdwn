Welcome to NVDA Quick Dictionary addon, which will allow you to quickly get a dictionary article with the translation of a word or phrase into your chosen language by pressing a key combination. There are few basic keyboard shortcuts and they are all intuitive and convenient so you will remember them quickly.

Dictionary articles contain detailed information about a word, such as part of speech, gender, plural or singular, translation options, list of meanings, synonyms and detailed examples. Such information will be useful for people who are learning foreign languages, or seek to use in communication all the richness and diversity of their own language.

The add-on supports several online dictionary services. You can select the desired remote dictionary in the appropriate dialog box or by using keyboard shortcuts. Each available service has its own settings panel.

There are also advanced opportunities for working with profiles of the voice synthesizers. You can associate a voice synthesizer profile with a specific language, after that translations into this language will be automatically voiced by the selected synthesizer.

Below are all the features of the add-on and keyboard shortcuts to control them. By default all functions are called using two-layer commands. But for any of these methods you can always assign convenient for you keyboard shortcuts. You can do it in the NVDA "Preferences" -> "Input gestures..." dialog.
