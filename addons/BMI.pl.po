"Welcome to the BMI Add-on! This is a plug-in designed to help determine the "
"Body Mass Index (BMI), which is an international measurement used to assess "
"a person's body fat level. With this Addon you can easily calculate your BMI "
"by providing your height and weight. In addition, we also offer a ranking of "
"the results, so that you can better understand your situation and take the "
"necessary steps to achieve and maintain good health."

"Note: For a proper interpretation of BMI, it is recommended to consider "
"other factors such as body composition, fat distribution, age, gender and "
"general health of the person. It is always recommended to consult a health "
"professional, such as a doctor or nutritionist, for a more accurate "
"assessment and to obtain proper guidance on health and weight."
