This addon provides some accessibility features for VLC Media Player.

1. Allows navigating through the playback controls using Tab and Shift+Tab. To activate a selected control press enter.
2. Reads status bar information (press I). The  gesture can be set up in NVDA preferences.
3. Says elapsed time when moving back and forward using  VLC keystrokes: Control plus left/right arrow to skip 1 minute and  Shift plus left/right arrows to skip 5 seconds. You can set the  verbosity in the NVDA preferences. You can also assign a keyboard shortcut to toggle it.
4. Announces state when change random mode (key R) and repeat mode (key L).
5. There are some  layered windows and panels that NVDA is not able to focus it automatically when they are displayed. Press Control+Tab to try to bring them to the front.

* Important note: This addon is optimized for versions of VLC 3.0 and higher; it will not work correctly with earlier versions.
