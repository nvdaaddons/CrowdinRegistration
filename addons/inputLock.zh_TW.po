"When you press the toggle input lock gesture, NVDA will say \"Input "
"locked\". Your input devices will be blocked until you press the same "

"again. In that moment, NVDA will say \"Touchpad unlocked\" and everything "

"lock category in NVDA settings dialog (NVDA 2018.2 and later) or from add-on "
"settings dialog for older versions, available under preferences menu. In "
"addition, from these settings you can control wether mouse locks when NVDA "
