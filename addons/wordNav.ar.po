"WordNav NVDA add-on improves built-in navigation by word, as well as adds "
"extra word navigation commands with different definition for the word. It "
"also provides word selection commands."

"Most text editors support Control+LeftArrow/RightArrow commands for word "
"navigation. However the definition of the word changes from one program to "
"another. This is especially true of modern web-based text editors, such as "
"Monaco. NVDA should know the definition of word in given program in order to "
"speak words correctly. If NVDA doesn't know the exact definition, then "
"either words are going to be skipped, or pronounced multiple times. "
"Moreover, some web-based text editors position the cursor in the end of the "
"word, instead of the beginning, making editing much harder for visually "
"impaired users. In order to combat this problem I have created enhanced word "
"navigation commands, that take the word definition from Notepad++ and they "
"do not rely on program's definition of words, but rather parse lines into "
"words on NVDA's side. The Control+LeftArrow/RightArrow gesture is not even "
"sent to the program, thus ensuring the consistency of the speech."

"Currently WordNav supports five definitions of the word, assigned to "

"`Left Control+Arrows`: Notepad++ definition, that treats alphanumeric "

"words. This should be the most convenient word definition for the majority "
"of users."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '

"`RightControl+Arrows`: Fine word definition splits `camelCaseIdentifiers` "
"and `underscore_separated_identifiers` into separate parts, thus allowing "
"the cursor to go into long identifiers."

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"`LeftControl+Windows+Arros`: Bulky word definition treats almost all "
"punctuation symbols adjacent to text as part of a single word, therefore it "

"word."

"Word selection is supported starting with WordNav v2.0. Just add `shift` "
"modifier to any word navigation gestures to select words. There is also one "
"extra gesture for word selection:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '

"`control+shift+numpad1` and `control+windows+shift+numpad1` select word to "

"Please note, however, that currently used accessibility APIs have multiple "
"issues related to word selection. Please get yourself familiar with the "
"following list of issues and workarounds:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"UIA applications (e.g. Notepad, Visual Studio, Microsoft Word) don't support "
"setting caret at the beginning of selection. In those applications caret "
"location is stored on WordNav side. As an adverse side effect, word "
"navigation commands might not play well with line and paragraph selection "
"commands (`shift+up/downArrow`, `control+shift+up/downArrow`) and results "
"might be unpredictable. For convenience, character selection commands "
"(`shift+left/rightArrow`) have been updated in WordNav for UIA applications "
"and should work well."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"Basic single line Windows edit controls also don't allow to set the caret in "
"front of selection, so the previous point also applies to them. This affects "
"all single line edit boxes within NVDA."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"IAccessible2 doesn't provide a way to set selection spanning across multiple "
"paragraphs. There is no known workaround for this issue. This affects rich "
"multiline edit boxes in Chrome and Firefox, such as compose email text area "
"in GMail and compose email window in Thunderbird."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"In notepad++ selection update messages come unreasonably slow. As a "
"workaround, WordNav announces selection on NVDA side for word selection "
"commands and silences late notifications for the following 0.5 seconds. As a "
"result, if you press word selection command followed by another (e.g. "
"character) selection command in quick succession, you might miss selection "
"notification for the latter one if it came within 0.5 seconds from the last "
"word selection command."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"In multiline edit boxes supporting TOM interface NVDA incorrectly identifies "
"cursor location when selection is present. This has been fixed in nvaccess/"
"nvda#16455, which is scheduled to be included in NVDA v2024.2 release. "
"Before that release word selection commands won't work correctly in TOM edit "
"boxes, such as NVDA log viewer."
