"Console Toolkit is NVDA add-on, that provides accessibility improvements for "
"Windows console, also known as Command prompt. It also works well in Windows "
"PowerShell. Some of the features may work in alternative terminals, such as "
"Cygwin, PuTTY and Windows Terminal, however, the add-on has only been "
"carefully tested with the default Windows Console. SSH users might find this "
"add-on especially handy."

"When \"Use UI Automation to access the Windows Console when available\" "
"option is enabled in NVDA settings, it sends one more control character in "
"the beginning of the string. This is needed to parse multiline commands "
"correctly: UIA implementation trims whitespaces in the end of each line, so "
"in order to deduce whether there is a space between two lines, we need to "
"shift them by one character. Please note, however, that this way we don't "

"the presence of spaces."
