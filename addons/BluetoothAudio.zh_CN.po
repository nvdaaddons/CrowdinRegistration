"Most bluetooth devices enter standby mode after a few seconds of inactivity. "
"That means that when NVDA starts speaking again, the first split second of "
"sound will be lost. Bluetooth Audio add-on prevents bluetooth devices from "
"entering standby mode by constantly playing a silent sound, that is "
"inaudible to a human ear."
msgstr ""
"大多数蓝牙设备在几秒钟不活动后进入待机模式。这意味着当NVDA再次开始朗读时，声"
"音的第一个瞬间就会丢失。蓝牙音频插件可以通过不断播放人耳无法听到的声播来防止"
"蓝牙设备进入待机模式。"

"Bluetooth Audio can optionally play white noise sound instead of silence. "
"This can be good for testing or to ascertain that Bluetooth Audio works as "
"expected. However, same level of audio quality improvement can be achieved "
"by playing silence."
