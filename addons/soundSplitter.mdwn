This add-on, partly based on Tony's Enhancements by Tony Malykh, adds the ability to split audio from NVDA and other sounds onto separate audio channels.

Note: this add-on is not intended to be used in secure screens.

## Commands:

* Alt+NvDA+S: toggle sound splitter between enabled with NVDA on the right channel, NVDA on the left channel, or disabled.

## Sound Splitter settings

You can configure add-on settings from NVDA menu/Preferences/Settings/Sound Splitter category.

* Split NVDA sound and applications' sounds into left and right channels: checkinb this checkbox will enable sound splitting feature.
