"This add-on allows the NVDA screen reader to connect to the Internet through "
"one or more proxy servers. To make it possible, it applies various patches "
"to the standard Python library or modifies certain environment variables, "
"depending on the chosen configuration. You will be able to update NVDA and "
"their add-ons automatically from your corporate environment and even perform "
"remote sessions, provided that your organization proxy server allows it."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"This add-on adds a new category to the NVDA settings dialog called "
"\"Proxy\". In this category, you will find four settings groups. The first "
"one allows you to configure a general proxy for all traffic. The other "
"groups allow you to configure proxy servers only for specific protocols. All "
"groups have the following fields:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"Host: hostname or ip address of the proxy server. Leave empty to disable "
"that particular proxy."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid "Port: server port."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid "Username: optional. User name for server authentication."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"Password: optional. Password for server authentication. Note that password "
"is not required for socks4 servers."

"Use proxy for dns requests if possible: when this checkbox is checked, "
"hostnames or domain names will be directly sent to and resolved on the proxy "
"server. When it is unchecked, names will be resolved locally and the server "
"will receive only the destination ip address. Note that not all socks4 proxy "
"servers support this option."

#. type: Plain text

"Tipically, most users will only have to configure the first settings group. "
