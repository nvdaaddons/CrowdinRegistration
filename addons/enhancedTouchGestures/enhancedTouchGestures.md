# Enhanced Touchscreen Gestures

* Authors: Joseph Lee, Kefas Lungu

This add-on provides additional touchscreen gestures for NVDA. It also provides a set of gestures for easier browse mode navigation.

Note: this add-on requires NVDA 2025.3.2 or later running on a touchscreen computer with Windows 10 or 11.

## Commands

### Available everywhere

* Two finger tripple tap: quits NVDA!
* Three finger flick right: press Tab.
* Three finger flick left: press Shift+Tab.
* Three finger flick down (object mode): read current window.
* Three finger double tap: cycles through speech symbol levels which determine what symbols are spoken.
* Three finger triple tap: toggles screen curtain.
* Four finger tap: cycles through audio ducking modes.
* Four finger double tap: toggle input help mode.
* Four finger flick left: report object with focus.
* Four finger flick right: report current navigator object.
* Four finger flick up: report title of the current window.
* Four finger flick down: report status bar text.

## Web touch mode

This touch mode, available in browse mode, allows you to navigate the document by selected element. To switch to web mode, from browse mode documents, perform 3 finger tap. From this mode, flicking up or down with one finger cycles through available element navigation modes, while flicking right or left with one finger moves to next or previous chosen element, respectively. Once you move away from browse mode documents, object touch mode is used.

Available web modes are: default (move through elements/objects regardless of type), links, buttons, form fields, headings, frames, tables, lists, graphics, landmarks, embedded objects (dialogs and web apps, for example), and text paragraphs.

## Synth settings touch mode

You can use this mode to quickly change synthesizer settings such as choosing a voice and changing volume. In this mode, use two finger flick left or right to move between synth settings and use two finger flick up and down gestures to change values. This gestures mirrors that of synth settings ring commands on the keyboard.
