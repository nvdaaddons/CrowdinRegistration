# Terminal Access for NVDA

An NVDA add-on that provides enhanced terminal accessibility for various Windows Terminals like PowerShell, WSL2, and others. Inspired by [TDSR (Terminal Data Structure Reader)](https://github.com/tspivey/tdsr), this add-on incorporates functionality from both TDSR and [Speakup](https://github.com/linux-speakup/speakup). Advanced features inspired by community suggestions and discussions.

## Overview

Terminal Access enables screen reader users to efficiently navigate and interact with command-line interfaces on Windows. The add-on integrates seamlessly with NVDA's built-in speech synthesis and provides comprehensive navigation and reading commands specifically designed for terminal usage.

## Features

### Command Layer (New)

- **Single-key command mode** - Press **NVDA+'** to enter the command layer; all commands become simple single-key presses (e.g. `i` for current line, `f` for search, `a` for say all)
- **No modifier conflicts** - The command layer avoids conflicts with other NVDA add-ons since all keys are unmodified while in the layer
- **Easy exit** - Press **Escape** or **NVDA+'** to leave the layer
- **Auto-exit on focus loss** - Layer deactivates automatically when you switch away from the terminal
- **Customizable** - All gestures appear in NVDA's Input Gestures dialog under "Terminal Access" for remapping

### Core Navigation

- **Line-by-line navigation** through terminal output
- **Word and character navigation** with phonetic spelling support

4. Restart NVDA when prompted

## Quick Start

When you open a supported terminal application, NVDA will announce:

> "Terminal Access support active. Press NVDA+shift+f1 for help."

Press **NVDA+Shift+F1** to open the comprehensive user guide.

### Key Gestures

Terminal Access provides keyboard shortcuts for efficient terminal navigation. For the complete list of gestures and detailed usage instructions, see:

- Press **NVDA+Shift+F1** while using the add-on to view the built-in guide
- View the [User Guide](addon/doc/en/readme.html) for detailed documentation
- Refer to `addon/doc/en/readme.html` file

**Quickest Start — Command Layer:**

- **NVDA+'** — Enter the command layer (single-key mode)
- Then press: **i** (current line), **o/u** (next/prev line), **k** (current word), **a** (say all), **f** (search), **Escape** (exit layer)

**Direct Gestures (alternative):**

- **NVDA+Alt+U/I/O** - Read previous/current/next line
- **NVDA+Alt+J/K/L** - Read previous/current/next word
- **NVDA+Alt+F** - Search terminal output

All gestures can be remapped in NVDA's Input Gestures dialog under "Terminal Access". For the complete list, see the [User Guide](addon/doc/en/readme.html).

## Configuration

Access Terminal Access settings through:

- NVDA menu > Preferences > Settings > Terminal Settings

### Available Settings

**Cursor Tracking** - Automatically announces the character at cursor position when it moves. Essential for monitoring position while navigating with arrow keys. Works with Cursor Delay to control timing.

**Cursor Tracking Mode** - Choose between four tracking modes:

- **Off**: No cursor tracking
- **Standard**: Announce character at cursor position (default)
- **Highlight**: Track and announce highlighted/inverse video text
- **Window**: Only track cursor within defined screen window

**Key Echo** - Announces each character as you type it. Provides immediate feedback for every keystroke. Works with Process Symbols and Condense Repeated Symbols for intelligent announcements.

**Line Pause** - Reserved for future continuous reading functionality. Currently preserved but not actively used.

**Announce Indentation When Reading Lines** - When enabled, automatically announces the indentation level (spaces and/or tabs) after reading each line with NVDA+U, I, or O. Essential for Python, YAML, and other indentation-sensitive code. Use NVDA+F5 to toggle quickly, or NVDA+I twice to query indentation of current line. Can be customized per application profile.

**Punctuation Level** - Controls how many symbols are announced (0-3):

- **Level 0 (None)**: No punctuation announced
- **Level 1 (Some)**: Basic punctuation (.,?!;:)
- **Level 2 (Most)**: Most punctuation (adds @#$%^&\*()_+=[]{}\\|<>/)
- **Level 3 (All)**: All punctuation and symbols
- Applies to typing echo, cursor tracking, and character navigation. Essential for developers who need to hear punctuation in code and commands without overwhelming verbosity in prose.

**Condense Repeated Symbols** - Counts repeated symbols and announces them as a group (e.g., "3 equals" instead of "equals equals equals"). Only works with symbols specified in "Repeated Symbols to Condense".

**Repeated Symbols to Condense** - Specifies which symbols to condense (default: `-_=!`). Customize for your workflow (e.g., `-=#` for Markdown users).

**Cursor Delay** - Delay in milliseconds (0-1000) before announcing cursor position changes. Lower values provide instant feedback but may overwhelm during rapid movement. Default: 20ms.

**Default Profile** - Select a profile to use when no application-specific profile is detected. Allows you to have custom settings apply by default rather than global settings. Use NVDA+F10 to check which profile is currently active and which is set as default.

### Settings Interactions

- **Quiet Mode** (NVDA+Shift+Q) temporarily disables cursor tracking and key echo
- **Indentation Announcement** (NVDA+F5) toggles indentation reading on line navigation
- **Process Symbols** affects cursor tracking, key echo, and character navigation
- **Condense Repeated Symbols** requires Key Echo to be enabled
- **Cursor Delay** only affects cursor tracking, not key echo or manual navigation
