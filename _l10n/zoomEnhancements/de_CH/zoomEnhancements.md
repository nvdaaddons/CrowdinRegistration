# Zoom Accessibility Enhancements add-on for NVDA

- Authors: Mohamad Suliman, Eilana Benish

This add-on improves the experience of using Zoom for NVDA users by providing keyboard shortcuts to handle alerts for different events while in a meeting, provides an alternative way to view the chat history in a meeting to overcome accessibility issues found sometimes in the native chat view of Zoom, and more...

Notes:

- You can configure screen reader alerts from Zoom itself (Zoom 5.2.1 and later). If an alert is disabled from Zoom itself, NVDA will not announce them even if alert reporting is enabled from the add-on. More information on configuring screen reader alerts can be found here: https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0066934.
- Alerts reporting configured via custom alerts reporting mode is optimized for Zoom interface in English.

## Keyboard shortcuts for controlling alerts in meetings

- NVDA+Ctrl+Shift+A: cycles between alerts reporting modes. The following modes are available:
  - Report all alerts mode where all alerts are reported as usual
  - Beep for alerts where NVDA will play a short beep for every alert displayed in Zoom
  - Silence all alerts where NVDA will ignore all alerts
  - Custom mode where the user can customize which alerts they want NVDA to announce. This can be done using the settings dialog of the add-on, or by using the dedicated keyboard shortcuts.

The following shortcuts can be used to toggle the announcements of each type of alert (note that this will be effective when custom mode is selected):

- NVDA+Ctrl+1: Participant Has Joined/Left Meeting (Host Only)
- NVDA+Ctrl+2: Participant Has Joined/Left Waiting Room (Host Only)
- NVDA+Ctrl+3: Audio Muted by Host
- NVDA+Ctrl+4: Video Stopped by Host
- NVDA+Ctrl+5: Screen Sharing Started/Stopped by a Participant
- NVDA+Ctrl+6: Recording Permission Granted/Revoked
- NVDA+Ctrl+7:  Public In-meeting Chat Received
- NVDA+Ctrl+8: Private In-meeting Chat Received
- NVDA+Ctrl+9: In-meeting File Upload Completed
- NVDA+Ctrl+0: Host Privilege Granted/Revoked
- NVDA+Shift+Ctrl+1: Participant Has Raised/Lowered Hand (Host Only)
- NVDA+Shift+Ctrl+2: Remote Control Permission Granted/Revoked
- NVDA+Shift+Ctrl+3: IM chat message received

Note that you need to leave reporting all alert types selected (in Zoom accessibility settings) to have the add-on function as expected.

## Keyboard shortcut for opening the add-on Dialog

NVDA+Z opens the add-on dialog. Using this dialog you can :

- See which alerts are announced and which aren't
- Select the types of the alerts you want to be announced
- Choose alerts reporting mode
- Save custom changes

## Remote control

It has been found out that Zoom now has a dedicated keyboard shortcuts to handle the remote control in an accessible manner. Use the following keyboard shortcuts to:

- Alt+Shift+r: to start remote control. Note that you need to have the permission of the remote controlled computer user to be able to proceed
- Alt + Shift + g: to give up remote control or to revoke it

## Chat history dialog

The add-on has a custom dialog where you can see all chat messages sent during the meeting while the add-on was running. To open this dialog, use NVDA+Ctrl+h. The dialog shows a list of the sent chat messages with their timestamps also (this works if two or more people were attending a meeting).
